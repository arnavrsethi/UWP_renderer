# UWP_renderer
UWPrenderer is a powerful Blender add-on that leverages the capabilities of UWP-compatible devices, (primarily devmode Xboxes), to offload rendering tasks from local machines. Connecting to these devices, UWPrenderer can reduce rendering time and enhance overall efficiency of Blender workflows.
