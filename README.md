**UWP_renderer (Blender Add-On)**
UWPrenderer is a powerful Blender add-on that leverages the capabilities of UWP-compatible devices, (primarily devmode Xboxes), to offload rendering tasks from local machines. Connecting to these devices, UWPrenderer can reduce rendering time and enhance overall efficiency of Blender workflows.

Features:
  -Offload rendering tasks to UWP-compatible devices, such as Xbox, for faster rendering.
  -Seamlessly connect to UWP-compatible devices within your local network.
  -Enhance the efficiency of your Blender workflow by reducing rendering time.
  -Utilize the power of UWP-compatible devices to handle resource-intensive 
   rendering tasks.

**Installation ('Workspace' Side)**
  - Download the add-on .py file from the repository 
  - Launch Blender and go to the "Edit" menu.
  - Select "Preferences" and navigate to the "Add-ons" tab.
  - Click on the "Install" button and locate the downloaded UWPrenderer add-on file.
  - Once selected, click on the "Install Add-on" button to install UWPrenderer.

  - Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection with your UWP-compatible device.
  - Once connected, select the desired rendering settings and click on the "Render" button.
  - UWPrenderer will offload the rendering tasks to the connected UWP-compatible device,   reducing rendering time.
  - Monitor the progress of the rendering task through the Blender interface.
  - After the rendering is complete, you can save the rendered output as usual.

**Troubleshooting**
  - Ensure that your UWP-compatible device is connected to the same local network as your computer.
